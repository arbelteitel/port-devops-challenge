# Port DevOps Challenge

ok so... thats my task 👐
we have here an EKS running my insanely comlpex app, with a working CI/CD via GitHub Actions (first time using it tbh).

if you have any questions regarding my choices - please ask me!

note:
ci is quite long because of cross-compilation, it would have been much easier to build the image directly to ARM, but since my GitHub is not a paid user, I don't have constant access to that feature - so I've decided to drop it for consistency.
